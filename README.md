The work based on this method is currently ranked 13th in [KITTI](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) named as "CAE-LO". And our paper is avialable on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.01354).

Now, only the evaluation data and some demos are published. The source code will be here until our paper is accepted.
